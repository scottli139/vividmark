# VividMark

A modern, lightweight Markdown editor built with Tauri 2.0 and React. Inspired by Typora, featuring a clean, distraction-free writing experience with real-time preview.

**Perfect for MkDocs**: Full support for MkDocs-specific syntax including admonitions (callout boxes), PlantUML diagrams, and advanced tables — making it an ideal editor for writing and previewing MkDocs documentation.
